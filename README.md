# Linked-lists-DSA
ğŸ“ƒMy first project -SEMESTER RESULT SYSTEM.
ğŸ™ŒğŸ”—I made it using linked list (DSA) with programming language C++.

About project: I have stored/read student's names their PRN NO.(Roll no.)
               and their all exam's marks(internal evaluation , mid term ,end term marks)
               then I calculate total , pointer and accordingly grades and finally stored 
               into linked lists which is my favorite linear data structure.
